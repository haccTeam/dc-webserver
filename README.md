Hello there, this repository contains code for a webserver. The main purpose of the webserver is to send a user files, which cross the Discord-API limit (8mb).

### Running the webserver
In your terminal, first type __`npm install`__ then run the webserver using __`node webserver.js`__ (PS: You can use __`npm run dev`__ to see your changes to the code in real-time.
